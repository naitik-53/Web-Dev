🌐 Web Development Journey 🚀

This repository documents my Web Development learning journey, where I practice and build projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while focusing on strong fundamentals and real-world problem solving.

The purpose of this repository is to grow step-by-step into a skilled frontend / full-stack developer, not just to follow tutorials.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

📖 Track my daily learning & practice

🧠 Build strong JavaScript fundamentals

🛠️ Create real projects to remove fear of JS

📈 Prepare for internships & advanced frameworks

🚀 Develop professional coding habits

🧩 Tech Stack Used

HTML5 – Semantic structure

CSS3 – Styling, layouts, animations

JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic, DOM, events

Browser APIs – Timers, localStorage

Git & GitHub – Version control

Vercel – Deployment

🧠 JavaScript Concepts Practiced

This repository focuses heavily on core JavaScript concepts, including:

Variables & Data Types

Operators & Expressions

Control Flow (if / else)

Loops (for, forEach)

Functions & Modular Thinking

Arrays & Objects

DOM Manipulation

Event Handling & Delegation

Form Validation (Regex)

🧠 Learning Philosophy

Think first. Code later.

I focus on:

Breaking problems into small steps

Identifying data before writing logic

Writing small, single-responsibility functions

Learning JavaScript through building, not memorizing

This repository reflects real learning progress, not copied code.

📈 Future Goals

🔵 Advanced JavaScript (Async, APIs)

⚛️ React.js fundamentals

🗄️ Backend basics (Node.js)

📱 Responsive & accessible UI

💼 Internship-ready portfolio
